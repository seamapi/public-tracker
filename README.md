# Seam Issues

This is the public Seam issue tracker.

## Reporting Issues

Go to the [Issues Tab](#) and click the green "New Issue" button. You'll be
presented with our Issue Template.

If you're a Seam Enterprise customer, you can mention any issues in Slack and
we'll track the corresponding Github issue.

## For Seam Engineers

### Do

- Link to internal slack conversations, threads, and internal issues
- Create helpful checklists with internal issues or descriptions
- Report known timelines
- Describe reproductions and known mitigations
- Edit the original issues with references to not spam watchers with notifications

### Don't

- Do not mention Customer company names, or any other identifying information
  in the public tracker
- Delete any customer information that is posted in an issue by deleting the
  offending comment. You may move any UUIDs or other relevant information to
  an internal tracking issue. If a UUID or device corresponds to a sandbox,
  it can stay.
- Never post customer data, uuids, or any other information from an account, in
  the public tracker. You can link to internal trackers that may have detailed
  information
